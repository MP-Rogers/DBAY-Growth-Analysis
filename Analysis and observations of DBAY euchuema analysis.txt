May 5, 2023 observations

[1] "The mean growth rate is to be 6.0618  grams per day + or - 5.2963"
[1] "The mean percentage growth rate is to be 5.8711  % per day + or - 3.5218"
[1] "The estimated mean time to double in size is  12  days(to the nearest day)"

From graph of mass against time
	aside from the 2 samples with noted ice ice breakage on april 26, all sampls grew in mass
	Even ice ice samples grow to above their initial weight by May 3
	Most samples seem to be growing faster in mass  btw april 26 and may 5
	
From mean absolute growth rate  against time
	Most around 6g per day as of may 6
	Ranges from (1.4% -12%) april 26 to (22%-0.7%) may 3
	Most clustered around the 5g per day mark
	
From graph of percentage growth rate against time
	percentages are a lot tighter than absolute mass growth rates (2% - 9% per day)
	2 -ve outliers from ice ice breakage
	even outliers fall close to the cluster of % by may 3
	
Total Mass of Samples: 3.44kg
Mean Mass of Samples: 190g

May 10, 2023 Data observations

[1] "The mean growth rate is to be 6.604  grams per day + or - 5.2338"
[1] "The mean percentage growth rate is to be 5.4345  % per day + or - 2.9735"
[1] "The estimated mean time to double in size is  13  days(to the nearest day)"

Total mass of samples has gone from: 1.7kg initally to 3.4kg(May 3) 4.46kg
Mean Mass is 223g up from 170g on May 3

From the graph of mass against time
	growth of all samples increasing
	Some samples have grown to "catch up other samples which began slightly heavier
	Not all samples growing at same rate/ not in the same mass order anymore
	
From Mean absolute growth against time
	Growth still scattered
	for most, absolute growth rate has eaither decreased or leveled off
	
For mean percentage growth rate
	Still a much tighter clusering than absolute growth rate
	Clustered mostly btw 3 and 5% growth per day
	Its more tightly clustered than it was last week, 
	
Total Mass of samples: 4.46kg
Mean Mass of Samples: 223g

May 17, 2023 Data Observations:

1] "The mean growth rate is to be 6.846  grams per day + or - 5.6187"
[1] "The mean percentage growth rate is to be 5.4668  % per day + or - 4.9329"
[1] "The estimated mean time to double in size is  13  days(to the nearest day)

Total Mass: 5.41kg
Mean Mass: 270.75

From the graph of mass against time
	All increasing
	rate of increase changing
	Order of mass changing(some outpacing others)

For mean percentage growth rate
	Very tight cluster
	Appears to be trending down (SA=urface are to volume? croweded lines?)
	No longe
	
No significany difernce in percentage grwoth rate between raft and line. some colour and growth form differences tho
